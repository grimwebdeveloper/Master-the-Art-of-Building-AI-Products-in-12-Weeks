# Foundations of Generative AI & LLM

## What is generative AI?

An AI that is able to generate text, images, audio, video, etc.

## What is LLM?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of Generative AI that primarily generate and understand text. Other types of Generative AI models are used for images, audio, and video.

## AI models and their capabilities

1. GPT model
2. Reasoning model

## Tokens

The smalles unit of text the model processes, like words or parts of words.

## Context

The surrounding text or information the model uses to understand and generate relavent response.

1. User input
2. Instructions
3. Additional information
4. Message history

## Context window

The maximum number of tokens an LLM can read and use at the same time to generate or predict text.

## Inference (Generating speed)

The process where an LLM takes input text and generate an output based on what it has learned.
